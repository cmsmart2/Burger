# Burger

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. To delete the burger from the database, the user can click on the "Delete this burger!" button below the burger they wish to remove from the list.

How You Can Get Started With This Project
To use the app:

Simply go to the Heroku link above. Input the names of burgers you would like to eat. Submit a burger's name, and the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it!" button. When you click it, the burger moves to the right side of the page. To delete the burger from the database, you can click on the "Delete this burger!" button below the burger you wish to remove from the list.

Why the Project is Useful
The app fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. Besides allowing me to continue working with Node.js and npm packages, the assignment also allowed me to work with express, express-handlebars, and MySQL.
